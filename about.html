                <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">
                    Luis’s Lemonade is inspired by a lemonade stand started by its founders- Luis and Lois Lotikii -12 years ago. The stand was famous for novel lemonade favors like: Vanilla, Chocolate, Batman black cola, and fantastic four fruits. Through Luis’s creative
                    mixes, and Lois’s business skills the stand was a hit. During their time running the stand Luis and Lois created the principles Luis’s Lemonade lives by today: Healing, Community, and Creativity.

                    <h2>Healing</h2>
                    <p>
                        What does your cup of Luis’s ”Turnt Toppled Over DrankXXX” have to do with healing? Everything. Here at a Luis’s Lemonade we believe that eating well made food, that you enjoy can help to improve your health. That’s we use only organic, fair traded products
                        to make our mixes and go out of our way to give all our drinks some medicinal value.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Community</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some of the best memories people have made are those were there with the people they love sharing a meal. In every drink we serve, and at every event we cater we bring a sense of community to everything we do.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Creativity</h2>
                    <p>
                        We here at Luis’s Lemonade take beverage’s to the next level. For us creativity is not adding a drink umbrella, food coloring, and calling it add. We experiment with everything from physical properties of the drink it self… (not done)
